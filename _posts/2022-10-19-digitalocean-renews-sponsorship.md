I'd like to take a moment to extend my gratitude toward [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) for renewing their sponsorship of NetBox. The credit allotted to our project allows us to maintain the community [demo instance](https://demo.netbox.dev/) and other resources at no cost.

DigitalOcean and NetBox have always had a special relationship. As longtime NetBox users likely already know, NetBox was originally conceived while I was working on the network engineering team at DO back in 2015. The company's willingness to not only permit the [release of the software](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4q39w0/netbox_is_now_open_source/) as an open source project, but to continue supporting its development for years afterward has made possible what NetBox is today.

If your organization is interested in sponsoring NetBox, please [let us know](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/wiki/Sponsorship)! Sponsorship is a great way for your company to gain recognition while supporting a very active and growing community of networking professionals.
