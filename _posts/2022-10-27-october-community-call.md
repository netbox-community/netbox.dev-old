The recording of our October community call is now [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YxNXb57NSkI)! We give a shout-out to [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) for [renewing their sponsorship](/announcements/digitalocean-renews-sponsorship/) of the open source project, then introduce the new [NetBox Zero to Hero](https://zerotohero.netbox.dev/) training content. I also walk through some of the [exciting new features](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av3.4) coming to NetBox v3.4! Keep an eye out for the beta release next month.
