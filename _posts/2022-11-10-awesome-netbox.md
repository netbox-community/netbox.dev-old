Fellow maintainer [Arthur Hanson](https://github.com/arthanson) has curated and published a _very_ thorough [list of awesome NetBox resources](https://github.com/netbox-community/awesome-netbox), aptly named `awesome-netbox`. While we've previously maintained a subset of this list on the [NetBox wiki](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/wiki), moving it to a dedicated repo should help it gain visibility and make it easier for others in the community to contribute their own additions.

The repo covers everything from the official docs and training to community plugins and other miscellaneous tools and resources. Check it out today, and let us know if anything is missing!
