I'm excited to announce today the official launch of [NetBox Labs](https://netboxlabs.com/), a new entity that will serve as the commercial steward for NetBox, [Orb](https://orb.community/), and future open source projects focused on network automation. Born from the original Labs team at NS1, NetBox Labs has a singular driving focus: Make it easier to build and manage complex networks.

We'll be sharing more news about NetBox Labs over the coming weeks, but for now [this blog post](https://netboxlabs.com/blog/netbox-labs-announcement) by CEO Kris Beevers outlines our initiative to bootstrap a truly _open source native_ business and further bolster the development of NetBox and its community.
