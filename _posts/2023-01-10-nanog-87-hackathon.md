[NANOG 87](https://www.nanog.org/events/nanog-87/) is taking place in Atlanta, Georgia next month, and the theme for its preceding hackathon is right up our alley: interacting with sources of truth.

Are you sitting on an idea for a new NetBox integration? Or maybe you'd just appreciate an opportunity to get more familiar with the API? The hackathon offers an opportunity to experiment with new ideas and collaborate with your fellow network engineers to build interesting tools with real world application.

I'll be representing NetBox at the hackathon, offering both project ideas and dedicated support hours for everyone in attendance. This is a perfect opportunity to dive into [plugin development](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-plugin-tutorial) or experiment with new [API integrations](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/integrations/rest-api/). I'm excited to see what people come up with!

Hackathon registration is **free** (no conference pass required) and open to both in-person and virtual attendees. The main event takes place over the weekend preceding the conference, February 11-12, and there's an introductory call on February 3rd. You can [register here](https://www.nanog.org/events/nanog-87-hackathon/).

Be sure to drop us a note on [the NetDev Slack](https://netdev.chat/) once you've registered!
